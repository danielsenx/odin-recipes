The current project is recipes HTML website. This is a very first project in The Odin Project course.
SELF-REFLECTION:
1. I learned how to make basic HTML boilerplate.
2. I learned how to make unordered and ordered lists, and how to nest them.
3. I learned how to create links to other HTML pages.
4. I learned how to insert images and alternative text.
